            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>An animated short film that weaves a dynamic journey through the perspectives of different life forms in a futuristic city.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="concept-story">
            <h2>Storyline</h2>
            <p>Below is the general storyline:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Water Perspective:</strong> The story begins with the perspective of a fish swimming underwater. The audience can observe the underwater scenery, potentially featuring remnants of human civilization (such as old buildings or tools).</li>
                <li><strong>Sky Perspective:</strong> The fish is caught by a bird, and the camera transitions to the birdâ€™s perspective. From high above, the cyberpunk city comes into view, with neon lights illuminating the night sky, alongside visible transportation networks and high-tech buildings.</li>
                <li><strong>Ground Perspective:</strong> The bird becomes prey to a stray cat, and the perspective shifts to the catâ€™s point of view. The cat navigates the city streets and pipes, highlighting the darker, more chaotic side of the urban environment.</li>
                <li><strong>Chase Perspective:</strong> A dog spots the cat and begins a pursuit, shifting the perspective to the dogâ€™s first-person view. This sequence takes the audience through a high-energy chase across various corners of the city.</li>
                <li><strong>Human Perspective:</strong> Finally, the dog is reunited with its owner, transitioning to the human perspective. The human walks the dog back home and opens a book, where the short filmâ€™s title, inspirations, and creator credits are displayed on the pages.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="concept-vision">
            <h2>Perspective Style</h2>
            <p>The majority of the scenes are presented from a first-person perspective, allowing the audience to experience the environment through the eyes of the main characters rather than seeing their full appearances. However, transitions between perspectivesâ€”such as when the fish is caught by the bird or the dog reunites with its ownerâ€”will briefly shift to a third-person view to emphasize key moments.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="concept-tools">
            <h2>Production Tools</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Maya:</strong> For creating 3D environments and animations.</li>
                <li><strong>Procreate and Other 2D Tools:</strong> To experiment with integrating 2D, flat-style animation into the film.</li>
                <li><strong>Premiere Pro:</strong> For video and sound editing.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="concept-inspiration">
            <h2>Inspirations</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Films:</strong> Love, Death & Robots, Arcane, and Cyberpunk: Edgerunners.</li>
                <li><strong>Games:</strong> Cyberpunk 2077 and Stray.</li>
